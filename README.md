# Random-Memes

This project serves just for learning purposes.
Its a small application using ejs for front-end while mainly focusing on backend.
In Backend i was testing authentication via sending jwt tokens in cookies.
The application can be also run in docker. 
The reason for Dockerfile and docker-compose was to try and have local dockerfile,
which is read and build with docker-compose and then adding mongoDB to it as well. I know it can be done easier, I just wanted to test it :P
